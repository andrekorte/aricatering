"""Run the assistant's guardrail tests.

    python3 chatbot/evals/run.py                  # test the prompt (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
    python3 chatbot/evals/run.py --only allergy   # one group
    python3 chatbot/evals/run.py --cases cases-th.json   # the Thai suite
    python3 chatbot/evals/run.py --endpoint https://.../chat   # a deployed worker

Two modes, deliberately
-----------------------
By default this calls the Anthropic API directly with exactly the system prompt
the worker builds. The thing under test for a RULE is the prompt, not the HTTP
plumbing: a rule can be broken without any worker existing, and CI should be
able to block that without deploying anything.

--endpoint tests the deployed worker instead. Same cases, different question:
"is the thing we shipped behaving?" rather than "do the rules hold?". Both are
worth running; only the first gates the build.

A prompt is code with no compiler. Every rule in chatbot/system-rules.md exists
because of a row in chatbot/RISKS.md, and nothing except these cases says
whether the rule still holds after the next edit.

Flakiness and retries
---------------------
The model is non-deterministic, so a correct-by-design bot occasionally trips a
case. Left unhandled that fails CI on random pushes and emails on every one -
and a gate that cries wolf gets ignored, which is alert fatigue dressed up as
diligence. So a failing case is retried (--retries, default 2 extra). CI fails
ONLY on a case that fails EVERY attempt: a consistent, reproducible regression.
A case that fails once and passes on retry is reported as FLAKY and listed,
never silently dropped - flakiness on a guardrail is a reason to tighten the
case or the rule, not something to hide.

Exits non-zero only on a consistent failure.
